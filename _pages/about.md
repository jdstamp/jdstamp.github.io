  I am a researcher with a strong technical and statistical background pursuing a PhD in computer science and computational biology at the Center for Computational Molecular Biology at Brown University. I am a member of the <a href="http://www.lcrawlab.com/">Crawford Lab</a> and the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/weinreichlab/home">Weinreich Lab</a>.
  My research focuses on developing statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to investigate the genetic architecture of complex traits, with a particular emphasis on how nonlinear interactions — both among genes and between genes and the environment — contribute to trait variation.

  Prior to returning to academic research, I worked as a software consultant. My experience at TNG Technology Consulting GmbH sharpened my practical skills in software development, automation, and cloud-based infrastructure. While working on a project that integrated DevOps and cloud technologies into the software systems of a publicly traded corporation, I gained firsthand experience in delivering production-ready software. These skills have become an integral part of how I approach research. To ensure my work is reproducible, tested, and accessible, I publish the statistical methods I develop not only as open-access scientific articles but also as open-source software packages. Proficient in Python, R, and C++, I thrive in projects that demand a combination of mathematical and technical expertise and creative problem-solving.

 I began my academic training with a Master’s degree in physics, during which I gradually discovered my passion for the statistical modeling of biological processes. This interest emerged through coursework and research in areas such as advanced statistical physics, pattern formation and nonlinear dynamics, and stochastic processes in biology. While the domain-specific knowledge I gained—particularly in physics and the origins of life—only partially carried over to my doctoral research, it provided me with a strong foundation in mathematical modeling and a complementary, first-principles perspective on biological systems.

  Outside of work, I enjoy running, traveling, and reading.
