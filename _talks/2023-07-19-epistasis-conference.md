Partitioning the trait variance is a powerful approach for the study of the genetic architecture of complex traits.
The Crawford lab developed novel methods that leverage trait variance partitioning to study complex traits. 
The marginal epistasis test (MAPIT) addresses the combinatorial search space and small effect problem of epistasis detection.
Modeling genetic correlations reveals pleiotropic trait architecture and improves sensitivity of epistasis detection.
The interaction-LD score regression reveals non-additive variation in human traits and improves heritability estimates on summary statistics.
